# Image Processing Techniques using OpenCV in Google Colab

This project demonstrates a series of image processing techniques, including **Canny Edge Detection**, **Gaussian Blur**, and **Green Color Detection** using **OpenCV** and **Python**. The project also allows users to upload an image in Google Colab, process it with different filters, and display the results using **Matplotlib**.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload their own images for processing.
- **Canny Edge Detection**: Detects edges in an image using the Canny algorithm.
- **Gaussian Blur**: Applies Gaussian smoothing to reduce noise and detail.
- **Green Color Detection**: Detects and highlights green colors within the image.
- **Final Combined Display**: Shows the original image, edge detection result, blurred image, and color-detected image together for comparison.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The programming language used for the project.
- **OpenCV**: The core library used for image processing tasks.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for visualizing the results.
- **NumPy**: Utilized for array operations and image manipulation.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python-headless`
- Matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`
- NumPy: `pip install numpy`

### Running the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd repository-name
Run the Project in Google Colab:

Open the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) in Google Colab.
Upload an image when prompted.
The code will process the image and display various results such as edge detection, blur, and color detection.
View Results: The results will be displayed in Matplotlib, showing the original and processed images.

Example Output
Here is an example of the output generated by the project:


Code Breakdown
Image Upload: The user uploads an image using Google Colab's files.upload() method.
Canny Edge Detection: Detects edges using the cv2.Canny() function.
Gaussian Blur: Applies Gaussian smoothing using cv2.GaussianBlur() to reduce noise in the image.
Green Color Detection: Detects green colors in the image using HSV color space and a mask.
Combined Display: Shows all results side-by-side using NumPy stacking and Matplotlib for visualization.
